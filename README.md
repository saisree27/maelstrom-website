# Maelstrom Monitor
React website which displays live games and statistics of [Maelstrom](https://github.com/saisree27/Maelstrom), a UCI chess engine I developed from scratch.

The website utilizes the Lichess API to fetch information about Maelstrom's lichess BOT account, which includes live games as well as ratings for various time controls. The website also uses the [PgnViewerJS](https://github.com/mliebelt/PgnViewerJS) library to display the PGN from either the live or most recent game played by Maelstrom.
